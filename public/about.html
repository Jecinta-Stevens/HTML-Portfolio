<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Egberi Jecinta Kevwe. A girl who is an enthusiaist for all things computer and tech related; from the intrisincs of coding to the maintaining and arranging of websites, softwares, tech tools, applications, and even interactive games, it all sparks a different kind of fire in me that I can almost not explain fully.</p>

<p>I'm a young earthling, a female to be exact, entering the male-dominated tech world. I mean, where do I even begin. But not to worry, I'll find my way through the  crowd, boring myself to the very top 1% of great developers.</p>

<p>For now, my favourite hobbies are pracicing what I'm taught and sharing my experience here on GitHub. I hope you find my forthcoming repositories exciting, as you walk through my progress.</p>

<p>And to my future self, I just want to say how proud of you I am. You're finally in your zone, in the right place for you to excel and sore beyond the skies. I've always believed in you. Don't stop now, you are just getting started. </br> <strong>Love you, always.</strong></p>
